MDB codes came originally from an outfit called NursingCAS:
https://nursingcas.org/resource/master-college-code-list-with-ceeb-codes/

The final list, however, came from a different outfit, Liaison
WebAdmit.  The URL there is
https://help.liaisonedu.com/WebAdMIT_Help_Center/Documents_and_Reference_Guides/Data_Dictionaries_and_Master_Code_Lists.

CEEB codes themselves came from the College Board.  I don't think I
have that URL, but they had a PDF listing of all the schools with
their CEEB codes, which I then massaged into CSV.
